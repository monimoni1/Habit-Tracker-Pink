FREE APP: Habit Tracker Pink

This is a Habit Tracking App with Flexible Frequency Options. There were no unpaid opytions in the market that allowed you to track more than 3 habits. 
Moreover, I feel like I was missing something like the overview option that would help me track my progress. 
Most Habit tracking apps out there also looked brutal and seemed moody, whereas I wanted something that looked flirty and fun. 
The app track's your progress over 100 days and has dates on the top row to help you keep in track. 
There are also Flexible Frequency options which means that you can choose to execute a habit every 1-7 days. 
(Watering my plants for example, I only need to do it every two days as opposed to every day.) 

I hope to add a notification function sometime in the future, and a to do list for the day, so that 
you can see at a glance what activities need to be executed that day. 

Thanks for downloading my API.
